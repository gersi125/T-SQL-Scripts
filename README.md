# T-SQL-Scripts
This is a set of materials that I have practiced when working with T-SQL in Mirosoft SQL Server. The scripts have short descritpions that explain thier functionalities.

Every script can be applied independently from the others and is valid in every database using the T-SQL language.
Most ofthe code is done for self-learning purposes and sql-tunning for better performance on large amount of data.
